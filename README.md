## Overview

In this assignment, the goal is to build an end-to-end pipeline of LLM agents that creates personalized investment portfolios based on user profiles. The system will leverage the OpenAI Chat Completions API to create specialized agents that collaborate to analyze market data, assess user risk tolerance, and recommend ETF portfolios tailored to individual interests and financial situations.

**Inspiration:** This assignment draws from recent research in LLM-based financial agents. See Stanford paper on [constructing portfolio of ETFs using Large Language Models](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1254/final-reports/256938687.pdf) for context.
